title: What is Poi?

Poi is a bundler for web applications, essentially it's just a webpack wrapper which improves developer experience by abstracting away a lot of configurations and providing better logs.

Oh and it allows you to reuse configurations, extend core features via `plugin`.

Yep, yup.

But if you want flexibility even more, webpack is still the choice. In the meanwhile, webpack 4 will be a lot faster than ever, and the webpack team plans to implement full caching and parallelism in webpack 5. ðŸ˜‰
